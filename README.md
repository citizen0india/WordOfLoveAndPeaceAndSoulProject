This parser provides a function to populate its data dictionaries from the custom source text and prints them into local directory files per custom alphabetical & unicode index order. 
Parser assumes all non-ascii letters in text are language-specific unicode.
The souce text formatting is expected as follows: Chapter-[Number] \n TEXT/TEXTS [Verse-Number or Verse-Number-Range] \n [Transliteration—Translation Word Pair;] [...] \n
Example: With input of Formatted Text of Bhagavad-Gita As It Is (Original 1972 Edition).
